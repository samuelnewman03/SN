#Variables Needed
Unpaid vs paid? How many? (Donâ€™t forget NAs)
How many are going private vs public? 
Regional: Where are students getting their internships? (LA, CA, Part of the coast)
Average Pay? (Convert units to hourly)
What type of pay? Stipend? Salary?
Average length of time? (Convert to weeks) 

#Add the sectors for internships (education, politics, etc)
